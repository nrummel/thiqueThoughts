We deserve more intelligent conversations about climbing just like other sports get during the Olympics on Sport Center or what have you. I have been enjoying a lot of the content out there (shouts [Nugget Pod](https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/olympic-reactions)). Here is mine.
# Women 
A fantastic competition waiting to happen. We are living in an era where we have a living üêê in Janja Gambret. She is the most [winningest climber](https://www.climbing.com/people/janja-garnbret-the-greatest-competitive-climber-of-all-time/) of all time. Some complain that there is nothing to watch but a competition for second place, but I think that the undercurrent of what must be going on with Janja herself and her competition plays out an amazing drama for us to witness. Just like how the Golden State Warriors arguable [revitalized the NBA](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5423748/2024/04/17/warriors-dynasty-run-end-nba-game-changing/).
## Vegas Odds 
After seeing who made finals this is my prediction of how the final results should come out. I give my score as if I were your book-y in the [familiar style](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/042115/betting-basics-fractional-decimal-american-moneyline-odds.asp):

1. -900, Janja Gambret - obvious choice. You don't need to be a statistician to know she had the best odds.
2. +100, Oriane Bertone - Hometown advantage. Arguably the most promising talent since Janja herself. She is strong, tall enough, coordinated and has some of the best game time performance. She won the Europe Champs coming in and had a decent performance at the [world champs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_IFSC_Climbing_World_Championships#Combined) taking 6th. Also, she is still relatively young at 19, and her trajectory is crazy. V14 at age 12, second place at her first world cup at age 16. Since then she has sustained a high output. Relatively, her injuries are non-existent. 
3. +250, Brooke Raboutou - Excellent pedigree:
	- Has experience at the olympic level, 4th in 2020(1)
	- Dominate in the Olympic Qualifying Series (OQS). 
	- History of performing well under pressure as a youth athlete and beyond
	This take is obviously biased as I am American and am a huge fan of Brooke in particular. 
4. +265, Ai Mori - Contentious choice her putting her below Brooke... She is very good and has been (arguably) more dominate that Brooke on the World Cup Circuit. She has been performing well in the last couple years, but her only Bouldering World Cup medal being a bronze in [Wujiang 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Mori) makes me give the edge to Brooke.  Also because of the nature of the Olympics as a showcase event, the setter may want to provide problems that are more gymnastic that will not suite Ai's more controlled style. 
5. +400, [Oceana MacKenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_Mackenzie) - I think she is drastically underrated. The level of talent necessary to perform at a World Cup finalist level while coming from a place where competition climbing is under-supported like AUS demonstrates Ms. Mackenzie's prowess. There is a good climbing dynasty down under for sure, but you are playing yourself if you don't believe that Europeans, Japanese and to a lesser extent Americans have an advantage over other countries.  All that being said, Oceana has been ramping as the Olympic approach with a 199.9/200 score at the Oceania Championships in 2023. Granted the even was probably under-cooked. Still, I am rooting for her. 
6. +800, [Jessica Pilz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pilz) - Although her accomplishments cannot be forgotten with both combined and lead world championship golds to her name, I think that she has looked underwhelming coming into the games. Injuries in the last few years have plagued her from making substantial progress in her conditioning, and competitive results have reflected this. While she still makes finals consistently, she has been a shadow of her previous self. Leaving room for the younger generation to take podiums where she once was/.  
7. +850, [Emile McNeice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McNeice) - A relatively underground climber coming into the games, she had an amazing run in the OQS. She is untested against the likes of Janja and company. While I wish Emile the best of luck I doubt she has the depth to come away with more that a decent showing in the final
8. +855, [Seo Chae-hyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo_Chae-hyun) - While she has many medals to her name and is one of three climbers to have ever dethroned the queen (Janja) in lead, in recent memory her performance has waned rather than waxed. In some ways I hope I am wrong and that Ms. Seo will make a resurgence when it matters most, but she wont. 
### Honorable mentions 
- [Natalia Grossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Grossman) - She should have made finals. By all measures she is an A to S tier climber. She deserved to be in the final. Wether it was head space alone or a lingering injury. I am beyond disappointed to not see the fight she could have brought to the Olympic final. 
- [Miho Nonaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miho_Nonaka) - Miho was a dominate figure in the World Cups and in the last Olympics taking the silver only to Janja out competing her countrywoman and the legend [Akiyo Noguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyo_Noguchi). I am sad to not see a rematch. Akiyo's career has had its ups and downs with injury. My understanding is at the present she is healthy, but you cannot downplay the cumulative effect that prolonged stretches of injury play on the training of an athlete. 
- [Laura Rogora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Rogora) - An unfortunately transparent mismanagement of talent. Laura could have been one of the best climbers of this generation, but her in ability to have power is obviously correlated with a lack of muscle necessary to be resilient in the sport.

## Postgame Analysis
WOW! Best climbing competition ever.... The commentary was amazing. NBC randomly listened to anything Matt Grooms has done ever for five minutes and correctly identified him as someones nephew (because that's the only possible reason he still has a job). Meghan Martin in particular had the unenviable job of threading the needle of talking to hard core fans (like me) and some in bread in the deep south who watches NASCAR. Blown away by her ability to speak accessibly and intelligently. 

The setting was outstanding. The setters created excellent separation while also putting on one hell of a show. Big shout out to [Garret Gregor](https://www.instagram.com/garrettgregor/) who I believe chief-ed the event. Some say that Ai was done a disservice through many large moves, but considering that the setting crew also had the likes of [Maragda Gabarre](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/videos/climbtoparis-meet-routesetter-maragda-gabarre) I doubt that height and reach were not duly considered. Also, recall Brooke only has one inch on Ai. Thus, in my opinion, the lack of a good result in Boulder falls directly on Ai and her team for not preparing for large moves. 

From the competitors themselves, I found the event gripping. I completely under estimated the pressure that Oriane must have been experiencing. She climbed quite stiff, and I think this lead her to under perform. Brooke exceeded all expectation as far as I am concerned while Janja lived up to the highest expectations possible. Both climbers were an obvious step above the competition. I really feel like Ms. Pilz outdid herself as well. What a comeback!
# Men
The men's field is a nice contrast with the women's in that there has not been a sustained dominance from a single male climber in nearly a decade. That being said the old guard that is present in the field is quite accomplished and still vying for their place on the podium with Adam Ondra, Jakob Schubert, Tomoa Narasaki and to a lesser extent Alex Megos. The young guns are on the rise with the likes of Toby Roberts, Sorato Anraku and Collin Duffy. This set the stage for a big show!
## Vegas Odds
1. -120, [Sorato Anraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorato_Anraku) - Winning both three lead, two bouldering, and a combined world cup in 2023 amongst other accolades Sorato demonstrated himself a real threat to take the crown. He did faltered in the combined event at the World Championships last year allowing Tomoa to qualify for the Olympics ahead of him. With a very competitive Japanese roster, this allowed doubt to trickle into everyone's mind that Sorato would not even compete in the games, but he then secured his seat with a dominate performance and the Asian Games. That all being said, he is without a doubt a legend in the making.
2. -110, [Jacob Schubert]() - Arguably he is the most well decorate male climber to be competing at the games with more medals than I am willing to count and outdoor ascents up to the highest grade in both bouldering and sport. Many consider the three discipline Olympic podium results to be unrepresentative and that Jakob deserved the Gold because Speed played a spoiler roll in this event.
3. -100, [Toby Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Roberts) -  Toby is another young star this time hailing from Great Britain. His rise through the World Cup Circuit in 2023 was one to behold. While his dominance is slightly overshadowed by the likes of Sorato who surpassed Roberts's medal count, there were a variety of factors including Roberts selecting to not compete in some events for the larger goal of Olympic preparation. I have a good feeling about him. 
4. 0, [Alberto Gin√©s L√≥pez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Gin%C3%A9s_L%C3%B3pez)- My fiends I have joked that we sold all our S&P and put it on Gin√©s L√≥pez üìà. He apparently has a talent for peaking at the right time. His medal count and overall performance in competition outside of the games leave much to be desired compared to the other finalists. In my mind he came out of no where to win in 2020 and then again this year is [surprisingly dominate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZjlWPcAicY) from what I can tell leading up to the games. 
5. 100, [Collin Duffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Duffy_(climber)) - I want to put the American higher on the list, but I don't really believe he is (currently) in the form to take gold. He is by all measures capable of such a performance, but his showing in Salt Lake this year was underwhelming as well as a less than optimal World Cup season in 2023.
6. 110, [Adam Ondra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ondra) - The best climber of all time, but perhaps not the best climber in 2024. Ondra's accomplishments in the sport on and off the rock are unparalleled. The world's best today are still trying to repeat all the route he has done outside, and when Ondra deemed to show up to competition events (in his prime) he was unbeatable. In the last five years both the competition has caught up to Mr. Ondra and he has seen a slight decline in output. 
7. 400, [Paul Jenft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jenft#:~:text=Paul%20Jenft%20(born%2016%20June,placing%208th%20in%20the%20final.) - Paul is a part of a strong contingent of French male climbers who are routinely making finals in the World Cups, but compared to [Sam Avezou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Avezou) or [Mejdi Schalck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mejdi_Schalck) his accomplishments are more modest with only a single bouldering World Cup bronze to his name. He body morphology is far outside the norm which may make his time in competition more unpredictable. He often finds "his own beta" to make his way to the top. 
8. 450, [Hamish McArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamish_McArthur) - While Hamish is quite the fun name and a good lead climber to boot, I think that he is a relatively inconsistent climber in finals and has not been on the podium in three years. There is an argument to expect him to outperform Paul, but I think that youth and momentum are on Mr. Jenft's side. 
### Honorable Mentions
- [Tomoa Narasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoa_Narasaki)- Such a huge bummer to not have him in finals. While Tomoa has accomplished much in his time, I do think that much of his potential was not realized. He should have podiumed at the 2020 games. He should have more World Cup and Championships golds to his name. His style and ability (at one time) were next level. This is truly a huge missed opportunity for him to demonstrate why he is the best of the best. 
- [Alexander Megos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Megos) - While Alex is without a doubt one of the best outdoor sport climbers of his generation, competition has never been his strongest discipline. My main commentary is that Alex has been relatively outspoken and critical of the combined format and Olympic climbing in general. He has some good points from my perspective, but from an optics stand point he comes off a sore and bitter loser. He has the physical ability and the talent to excel at both boulder and sport like all the other top dogs, and he has not realized his potential. That is on him not the event. 
- [Lee Do-hyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Do-hyun)- With an impressive run in OQS, I felt that Mr. Lee was ramping. There was an outside chance for him to fully dark-horse his way to the top. He is young and will have many more opportunities to shine.

## Post Game Analysis 
Again, it is incredible as a fan to have a professional run the stream. The editing was on point and the commentary was a step above the norm. I also appreciate how these streams captured the intangibles of the event like the atmosphere and the moments when the athlete know they won or made the podium. Overall, the production was so good that I forgot it was even a factor. This is how is should be. Instead of yelling at the YouTube because the [camera man and editor is pervert ](https://www.businessinsider.com/climber-sexualisation-tv-cameras-keep-focusing-on-her-butt-2021-9) or the commentator is reexplaining how the scoring works in a nails on chalk board way, I just could sit back and enjoy the sport. 

Beyond the production, the competition was real! Truly a fight for the top spots. The setting complemented the athletes who were present. The athletes themselves fought their hardest, and there were no big flops as far as I'm concerned. Seeing Toby take gold feels like a passing of the torch from the ents to the young bucks. I
