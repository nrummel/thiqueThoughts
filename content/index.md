Welcome to Thique Thoughts! My name is Nic Rummel, and I am an avid rock climber and applied mathematician. I created this as a way to share the details of how I think about the sport rock climbing through a mathematical lens. I am passionate about bringing thoughtful and accessible conversations about the sport that I love.
